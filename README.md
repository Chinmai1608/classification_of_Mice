# Classification of Mice Based on Protein Expression Levels
### Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to analyze protein expression levels in the cerebral cortex of mice to classify them into different categories based on their genotype, behavior, and treatment. Specifically, the project aims to identify subsets of proteins that can discriminate between these classes and to understand the biological mechanisms underlying learning and memory, particularly in the context of Down syndrome.

### Objective

##### Classify Mice Based on Protein Expression:
Develop a machine learning model to accurately classify mice into one of the eight classes based on the expression levels of 77 proteins. These classes are determined by a combination of genotype (control or trisomic), behavior (stimulated to learn or not), and treatment (saline or memantine).

##### Identify Key Discriminant Proteins: 
Utilize feature selection techniques to identify which proteins or protein modifications are most important for distinguishing between the different classes. Understanding which proteins are key discriminators can provide insights into the biological mechanisms underlying learning and memory in Down syndrome.

##### Evaluate the Impact of Genotype, Behavior, and Treatment: 
Analyze the effect of genotype (control vs. trisomic), behavior (context-shock vs. shock-context), and treatment (saline vs. memantine) on protein expression levels. This includes evaluating how these factors influence associative learning and the potential therapeutic effects of memantine in trisomic mice.


### Dataset Description

### Steps Involved

#### 1.Data Preprocessing:

*Handling Missing Values: This step involves identifying and dealing with any missing or null values in the dataset. Various strategies can be used, such as imputation with mean or median values, or using more advanced techniques like k-nearest neighbors (KNN) imputation.

*Normalization/Scaling: Protein expression levels can vary greatly, so it’s essential to normalize or scale the data to ensure that each protein contributes equally to the analysis. Common techniques include Min-Max scaling and Z-score normalization.

*Encoding Categorical Variables: If there are any categorical variables in the dataset, they need to be encoded into a numerical format that can be used by machine learning algorithms. This can be done using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

#### 2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

*Summary Statistics: Calculate and examine summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for each protein to understand the distribution and variability of the data.

*Visualizations: Create visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to explore the data distribution and relationships between different proteins and classes. These visualizations can provide valuable insights and help identify any patterns or anomalies in the data.

*Correlation Analysis: Analyze the correlations between different proteins to understand their relationships. Highly correlated proteins might provide redundant information, so identifying these can be important for feature selection.

#### 3.Feature Selection:

*Correlation Analysis: As mentioned, correlation analysis can help identify highly correlated features. Features with high correlations may be redundant and can be removed to reduce dimensionality without losing much information.

*Mutual Information: This technique measures the amount of information one variable provides about another. It can help identify which proteins are most informative for distinguishing between the classes.

*Feature Importance from Models: Train simple models like Random Forests or Gradient Boosted Trees and use their feature importance scores to identify the most significant proteins.

#### 4.Model Training:

*Data Splitting: Split the data into training and testing sets, typically using a ratio like 70:30 or 80:20. This allows for unbiased evaluation of the model’s performance.

*Model Selection: Experiment with different machine learning models such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks to find the best-performing model.

*Hyperparameter Tuning: Use techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to optimize the hyperparameters of the chosen model. Cross-validation can be used to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

#### 5.Model Evaluation:

*Evaluation Metrics: Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of the models. These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of the model’s strengths and weaknesses.

*Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix can help visualize the performance of the classification model, showing the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives for each class.

#### 6.Interpretation of Results:

*Identifying Key Proteins: Analyze the final model to identify the key proteins that are most important for classification. These proteins can provide insights into the biological processes involved in learning and memory.

*Biological Interpretation: Interpret the results in the context of biological knowledge. Discuss how the identified proteins relate to known pathways and mechanisms involved in Down syndrome and associative learning.
